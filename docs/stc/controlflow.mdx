## Conditional Execution (`if`)

The `if` statement pops a value from the stack and executes the block if the value is non-zero (true).

```stack
3 3 == if {
    5 print
}
```

**Output**:

```
5
```

:::info
**Explanation**:  
The `if` statement pop from stack value and check if it is true (diffrent from `0`). If true, the block `{ 5 print }` is executed, printing `5`.

## Loops

### Repetition (`repeat`)

The `repeat` statement pops a value `n` from the stack and performs the enclosed block `n` times.

```stack
0
5 repeat {
    1 + print
}
```

**Output**:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

:::note
**Explanation**:  
The `repeat` statement executes the block `n` times, incrementing and printing each value starting from `0`.
:::

### Iteration with Index

The `repeat` statement can pass the current iteration index (starting from `0` to `n-1`) by assigning a variable to the statement:

```stack
0
5 repeat (idx) {
    idx print
}
```

**Output**:

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

:::info
**Explanation**:  
The `repeat (idx)` syntax allows passing the current index as a variable, enabling access to the iteration count for more flexible loop operations.
