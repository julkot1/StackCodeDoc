# Intro


# Reverse Polish Notation Language (Stack Code)
Stack Code is a playful and experimental language built with Go and LLVM (version 14). While itâ€™s still a work in progress, the aim is to explore stack-oriented programming in a dynamic, C-compatible environment. Note: This language is not yet fully developed and serves more as a fun exploration!

## Language Features

-  **Dynamically Typed**: Types are checked and managed at runtime.

-  **Stack-Oriented**: Operates primarily through a stack-based paradigm. [Learn more about stack-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming).

-  **glibc Based**: Built on top of the GNU C Library.

-  **Easy C Binding**: Simplifies integration with C functions.
